# LogicSugar — Agent Notes

Mindustry Java mod that adds structured `for` / `while` / `switch` / function blocks to the
logic editor while storing vanilla-compatible mlog. Workspace-wide rules (build modes, dev
identity `LogicSugar-dev / 0.0.0`, release safety) live in the parent `codex/AGENTS.md`;
this file only adds what is specific to this project.

## Build & Test

```powershell
cd LogicSugar; ./gradlew check        # runs selfTest, ifElseTest, decompileTest, crossLoaderTest
./gradlew check jar                   # build + dev jar at build/libs/ (copy to 构建/LogicSugar/LogicSugar-dev.jar)
```

The self-tests are `main()`-based JavaExec tasks (no JUnit runner). New regression coverage
should follow that convention and be added to `check.dependsOn`.

## Mod class loader vs. game classes (critical, easy to miss)

At runtime this mod's classes load through a **mod class loader** while `mindustry.logic.*`
game classes load through the app loader. Same package name, **different runtime packages**:

- `protected` / package-private members of game classes (`LStatement.field`,
  `LStatement.showSelect`, `LogicDialog.privileged`/`consumer`, …) may only be accessed
  1. from **inside our own subclasses** — subclass access to protected members is legal
     across loaders (this is why `SugarStatement.fieldsHint` works), or
  2. **reflectively** via `Field.setAccessible(true)` (see `SugarLogicDialog.privilegedField`
     for the established pattern).
- A static helper in `SugarStatements` (or any non-subclass of ours) calling those members
  **compiles fine** — javac only sees the source-level package match — and throws
  `IllegalAccessError` at runtime the first time the UI renders. This bit the first
  `addCompactOp` implementation (crash 2026-08-27).
- Rule: any helper that touches protected game-class members must be an instance method on
  the `SugarStatement` subclass (public if a static editor like
  `rebuildConditionEditor` needs to call it). Static code may only use public game API.
- `crossLoaderTest` simulates this loader split headlessly (child-first loader defines our
  classes, `LStatement` stays on the parent) and fails with guidance if the pattern
  regresses.

## Decompiler safety gate

`SugarDecompiler` may only return recovered Sugar source after recompiling it and comparing
the normalized instruction stream against the input (`verify`). Anything unrecognized falls
back to raw vanilla statements. When touching recovery logic, keep every new pattern behind
that gate; failure direction must always be "show more vanilla code", never "rewrite unknown
programs".
